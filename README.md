## 🧠 Model Overview

### 🧩 Generator
The generator transforms 100-dimensional random noise vectors into 64×64 RGB images using a series of transposed convolutional layers.

**Architecture Summary**
| Layer | Output Shape | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Dense | (8×8×256) | Initial projection |
| Reshape | (8, 8, 256) | Start of upsampling |
| Conv2DTranspose (128) | (8, 8, 128) | Upsampling |
| Conv2DTranspose (64) | (16, 16, 64) | Upsampling |
| Conv2DTranspose (32) | (32, 32, 32) | Upsampling |
| Conv2DTranspose (3, tanh) | (64, 64, 3) | Output image |

---

### 🧩 Discriminator
The discriminator distinguishes between **real** and **generated** images using convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activations and dropout for regularization.

**Architecture Summary**
| Layer | Output Shape | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Conv2D (64) | (32, 32, 64) | Feature extraction |
| Conv2D (128) | (16, 16, 128) | Deeper feature mapping |
| Conv2D (256) | (8, 8, 256) | Compact representation |
| Flatten + Dense(1) | - | Real/Fake classification output |

### ⚙️ Training Configuration
- **Loss Functions:** Binary cross-entropy (from logits)  
- **Optimizers:** Adam (learning rate = 1e-4)  
- **Batch Size:** 128  
- **Epochs:** 50 (default)  
- **Noise Dimension:** 100  
- **Normalization:** Image pixel values scaled to [-1, 1]
## 📸 Results

> Below are sample outputs generated by the DCGAN during training.  
> Images will be updated as training progresses and model quality improves.

| Epoch | Sample Output |
|:-----:|:---------------:|
| 1 | ![epoch1](samples/epoch_0001.png) |
| 10 | ![epoch10](samples/epoch_0010.png) |
| 25 | ![epoch25](samples/epoch_0025.png) |
| 50 | ![epoch50](samples/epoch_0050.png) |

*(Replace the image file names with your actual outputs.  
Each image should be saved automatically in the `samples/` folder during training.)*

### 📈 Observations
- As training progresses, generated faces gradually gain sharper and more realistic features.  
- Early epochs typically show blurred or noisy images.  
- Mid to late epochs (around 30–50) begin to capture facial structure, symmetry, and color distribution.  
- Training stability and quality can be improved by adjusting:
  - Learning rates of the generator and discriminator
  - Batch normalization placement
  - Training ratio (e.g., multiple discriminator updates per generator update)
